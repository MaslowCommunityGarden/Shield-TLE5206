The new shield v1.4 offers many improvements over it's predecessor.

Every single one chip, out of the three TLE5206 on the latest v1.4 board is capable of driving more power than the whole old 1.2 shield!

- 3 dedicated motor drivers, one chip (TLE5206) for each motor.
- Each chip delivers up to 5A continuous, 15A combined.
- Output full short circuit protected.
- Over temperature protection.
- Under voltage lockout.
- Bolted, bigger/better heat sink.

This v1.4 shield is in total almost 4 times more powerful than the older version, and uses one dedicated 5A (6A peak) for each motor, with stainless steel bolted and soldered heat-sinks (not sticker mounted as the v1.2) for maximum heat protection.

It is made in USA with name brand components from authorized distributors, to ensure safety and performance.
